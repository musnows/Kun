## Context

The current `origin/develop` baseline exposes Extension API v1.0 with full-page Webviews, commands, workspace read/write, Agent runs, Agent profiles, and extension tools. It does not expose workspace directory creation or atomic rename. PPT Master remains the managed Markdown-to-PPTX path and is intentionally separate from this HTML-first editing experience.

The NQ reference project edits arbitrary HTML inside an unsandboxed iframe and exports a full runtime DOM snapshot. Its generated element IDs do not survive reopen, its change map is not a real operation log, and arbitrary slide scripts would share an unsafe execution surface in an Electron renderer. The new extension therefore uses a constrained presentation model rather than importing that runtime.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Make one presentation editable by both a person and an extension-owned Kun Agent without last-writer-wins data loss.
- Keep the canonical artifact directly openable as a standalone HTML presentation.
- Keep slide and element identity stable across sessions and exports.
- Use only public Extension API v1.0 surfaces and minimum required permissions.
- Keep every tool schema, file, message, operation batch, and retained idempotency record bounded.
- Preserve Kun's existing tool approval, sandbox, cancellation, catalog, and single-runtime behavior.

**Non-Goals:**

- Importing arbitrary HTML or executing user/Agent-authored JavaScript in the extension Webview.
- PPTX/PDF import or export, animation timelines, charts, multiplayer CRDT, or pixel-perfect PowerPoint compatibility.
- Replacing or weakening managed PPT Master.
- Cherry-picking the legacy PPTist bridge or the local-only Extension API v1.1/video-editor stack.
- Adding PPT-specific private IPC or relaxing the extension CSP.

## Decisions

### 1. A constrained AST is embedded in the standalone HTML file

A deck is saved as `<name>.kun-ppt.html`. A non-executable `application/json` marker contains a schema-versioned model with document metadata, theme, slides, elements, revision, and a bounded operation receipt log. The rest of the file is a deterministic HTML/CSS projection with persistent `data-kun-slide-id` and `data-kun-element-id` attributes.

Using one root-level file works within the v1.0 Workspace Broker, which cannot create directories. It is also directly previewable outside Kun and avoids a JSON/HTML pair becoming inconsistent. The parser reads only the exact JSON marker and never treats arbitrary surrounding HTML as editor authority.

### 2. Manual and Agent edits share one typed reducer

The shared engine accepts bounded operations for document metadata, slide insert/update/delete/reorder, and element upsert/delete. It validates the resulting model and returns changed IDs, warnings, and inverse operations. The Webview uses those inverse operations for undo/redo; the Agent tool uses the same reducer for batch edits.

Elements are a discriminated union of text, shape, and workspace-relative image blocks. Geometry uses percentages on a fixed 16:9 canvas. Colors, fonts, paths, text lengths, slide counts, element counts, and total serialized bytes are constrained before projection.

### 3. Persistence uses revision checks, receipts, and a per-path queue

Every mutation supplies `expectedRevision`. The host rereads the file, compares revisions, applies the batch, increments once, renders the complete canonical HTML, rechecks the prior content immediately before `context.workspace.writeFile`, then rereads it for verification. Calls for paths that differ only by ASCII case are serialized inside the extension host.

Agent mutations also supply an `operationId`. A digest and resulting revision are retained in a bounded receipt list, making a same-input retry return the prior success while rejecting reuse with different input. Extension API v1.0 offers neither atomic rename nor atomic conditional/create-only writes. Revision checks, immediate pre-write rechecks, per-path serialization, and post-write verification cover normal UI/Agent races inside one Extension Host, while cross-process atomicity is explicitly deferred.

### 4. The Webview is a trusted renderer for untrusted structured data

The full-page Webview builds slide DOM with `createElement`, `textContent`, validated style values, and broker-loaded workspace images. It never injects presentation HTML with `innerHTML`, never creates a nested iframe, and never enables remote network access. The file projection escapes all text and attributes and includes a restrictive standalone CSP.

The editor offers a slide rail, responsive 16:9 canvas, drag/resize, inline text editing, property inspector, slide operations, undo/redo, preview, and debounced save. Before starting or steering the Agent, it flushes pending edits so the Agent reads the current revision. A revision conflict never overwrites; the UI asks for reload.

### 5. A dedicated Agent profile uses five narrow tools

The private `presentation-designer` profile may use only `presentation-create`, `presentation-read`, `presentation-apply`, `presentation-validate`, and `presentation-export-copy`. Its instructions require reading the current revision before edits, using stable IDs, applying bounded batches, refreshing on conflicts, validating before completion, and treating PPTX as a separate PPT Master workflow.

The same tools remain available through Kun's normal extension ToolHost path. Declarations are defined once in TypeScript and regression-tested against the Manifest, so side-effect classification, input/output schemas, and output limits cannot silently drift.

### 6. Completed turns surface presentation artifacts through the existing system opener

Successful workspace-write tool results already carry a resolved `filePath`, but PPT Master names its final path as `output_path` and the chat timeline currently surfaces only file changes with unified diffs. The mapper therefore recognizes bounded output/destination path aliases and unwraps the progressive extension gateway's `result.content` envelope. A pure turn-level collector selects only `.ppt`/`.pptx` outputs plus `.kun-ppt.html` outputs whose provenance was derived from the real Presentation Studio tool identity and whose tool result carries the extension's verified content SHA-256. It rejects traversal and lexically external paths, applies platform-aware path identity, and renders the cards only after the turn finishes.

The primary card action calls the existing `editor:open-path` bridge with `editorId: "system"` and the main-owned `presentation-artifact` open policy. The main process resolves and confines the path to the active workspace, verifies that the canonical target is a regular file ending in `.ppt`, `.pptx`, or `.kun-ppt.html`, and for HTML recomputes the current bytes' SHA-256 against the trusted tool result before using Electron `shell.openPath`. This prevents a presentation-looking symlink or a post-generation HTML overwrite from launching different content while still letting WPS, PowerPoint, or the browser be selected by the operating system. A second action reuses the existing file-manager reveal path and the same fixed type policy. No new IPC channel or application-specific executable discovery is introduced.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- [Risk] A single HTML file can grow large. -> Cap the model and rendered file below the public 1 MiB tool/message budget and reject oversized edits before writing.
- [Risk] Extension API v1.0 writes are not rename-atomic or conditionally atomic. -> Serialize case-folded paths, recheck directly before persistence, verify the post-write document, and document cross-process atomic storage as a future platform improvement.
- [Risk] Workspace images may be missing or too large. -> Validate relative paths, use bounded broker reads, show a non-fatal placeholder, and report validation warnings.
- [Risk] Agent and user edit concurrently. -> Flush UI edits before Agent input and fail closed on revision mismatch rather than automatically merging.
- [Risk] HTML projection could become an XSS surface. -> Project only validated AST fields, escape every text/attribute value, forbid arbitrary CSS/script, and keep the bridge-bearing Webview independent of the exported markup.
- [Risk] A tool may report a presentation-looking path that no longer exists. -> Keep path resolution in the main process, show a bounded open failure in the card, and never attempt a shell-command fallback.
- [Risk] A generic writer or symlink may disguise executable content as a presentation path. -> Require runtime-derived Presentation Studio provenance and a verified write-time digest for standalone HTML, then revalidate the canonical target's regular-file type, suffix, and current content digest in the main process.

## Migration Plan

No persisted Kun data migration is required. Development and production builds package the example into the product-owned bundled extension catalog, and the existing normal registry seeder installs it for clean profiles and profiles that have not explicitly removed it. Create a new `.kun-ppt.html` deck and edit it through the contributed full-page View or tools. Future schema versions must add explicit model migration before accepting older files. Explicitly uninstalling the extension remains durable, and removing the extension leaves standalone presentation files intact.

## Open Questions

- A future Extension API revision may add atomic workspace transactions and directory creation; the project service should adopt those without changing the deck operation contract.
- Native PPTX/PDF export can be added later as an explicitly version-pinned, non-destructive background job rather than importing the legacy PPTist bridge.
