# Agent Request Observability

Kun's **Agent Perspective** is a local, thread-scoped HTTP inspector for model requests. It captures the effective request assembled by `CompatModelClient`, each retry or compatibility fallback, the HTTP response, the bounded raw response stream, and Kun's decoded output. The feature is for inspecting a conversation; it is not a runtime/process diagnostics panel and has no provider controls or replay action.

## Framework review

The existing ecosystem is useful, but its standard trace model and Kun's wire-inspection requirement are different layers:

| Project | Strength | Fit for exact Kun HTTP inspection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai) | Vendor-neutral GenAI spans, metrics, events, and export | Good metadata/export vocabulary. Standard spans do not promise the literal final HTTP URL, headers, request bytes, or raw SSE frames. |
| [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs/observability/overview) | LLM traces, generations, scores, prompt management, and self-hosting | Good optional trace backend; still needs Kun-specific Fetch-boundary capture for exact wire data. |
| [Arize Phoenix](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix) | OpenTelemetry/OpenInference tracing, evaluation, and a local/self-hosted UI | Good investigation backend and future exporter target; normal semantic instrumentation is not a raw HTTP recorder. |
| [Opik](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/) | Open-source LLM tracing, evaluation, dashboards, and self-hosting | Good full-trace product; integrating its SDK would not remove the need to capture Kun's retries and raw stream itself. |
| [LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/langsmith/observability) | Agent tracing, monitoring, evaluation, OpenTelemetry ingestion | Strong managed/enterprise workflow; not an offline, exact-wire default for the Electron app. |
| [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry) | OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation for common LLM SDKs | Useful when a supported SDK owns the call. Kun uses a custom compatibility client and needs stricter content and credential handling. |
| [Helicone](https://github.com/Helicone/helicone) | Gateway/proxy observability close to the HTTP wire | Can see provider traffic, but making a proxy mandatory changes the request hot path, endpoint, authentication, and deployment model. |
| [BeeAI Agent Stack](https://github.com/i-am-bee/agentstack) | Open-source agent platform and orchestration | Relevant as an agent stack, but not a drop-in per-request wire inspector for Kun's single bundled runtime. |

The implementation therefore captures locally at the existing `fetch` boundary and uses stable fields that can later map to OpenTelemetry GenAI attributes. Kun's existing content-free `AgentObservabilityRecorder` remains the opt-in span/export path; Agent Perspective does not upload sensitive content.

## Capture boundary and coverage

One logical model round may produce multiple HTTP exchange records:

- `initial`: the first provider call.
- `transport_retry`: a retry after a configured transient HTTP status.
- `stream_options_fallback`: a compatibility retry with a changed request body after a provider rejects `stream_options`.

Each record includes:

- thread, turn, provider, model, endpoint format, attempt ordinal, and reason;
- final sanitized request URL, POST headers, and the exact JSON string supplied to `fetch`;
- response status, status text, headers, and bounded raw response text (including SSE framing);
- start, time-to-headers, finish, duration, transport/capture errors, and truncation metadata;
- the semantic text, reasoning, tool calls, usage, stop reason, or error decoded by Kun.

Coverage is intentionally limited to HTTP-backed providers routed through `CompatModelClient`. Agent SDK transports, renderer requests, tool traffic, MCP traffic, Write inline completion, scheduled-task detection, and other Electron services are not captured by this first version. An empty Agent Perspective panel for such a turn does not mean that no non-model network traffic occurred.

The recorder never retries, rewrites, replays, or blocks a provider request because capture failed. It serializes each request body once, observes a cloned response, and isolates recorder failures from the agent-visible result.

## Security and local storage

Completed exchange records are append-only JSONL files at:

```text
<Kun dataDir>/observability/model-http/<base64url-thread-id>.jsonl
```

The observability directory is forced to mode `0700` and trace files to `0600`. Active attempts live only in bounded runtime memory and are merged with completed records when queried. Deleting a conversation waits for its lifecycle fence and deletes its trace file. Malformed JSONL lines are ignored with a warning so an interrupted final append does not make the inspector unusable.

Credential values are removed **before** a record enters memory or storage:

- URL user info is stripped.
- Query values whose names imply keys, tokens, secrets, signatures, authentication, passwords, credentials, or cookies become `[REDACTED]`.
- authorization, API-key, token, secret, cookie, signature, and similar request/response header values become `[REDACTED]`.
- A configured API key is also redacted if it appears in another header value.

Header names are retained so request construction remains diagnosable. Request and response **bodies are intentionally not redacted**, because prompts and provider output are the data the inspector exists to show. Treat the trace directory as sensitive user data; do not attach it to an issue without reviewing its bodies.

The default capture limit is 4 MiB for each request body and each response body. Records expose captured/original byte counts and an explicit truncation flag. Truncation affects only the retained copy, not the provider request or primary response parser. Disk JSONL currently has no age-based automatic eviction; it follows the conversation lifetime.

## API

The renderer uses the authenticated runtime route:

```http
GET /v1/threads/{threadId}/model-requests?limit=30&cursor=<opaque>
Authorization: Bearer <runtime-token>
```

The route first verifies that the thread exists, then returns newest-first records, an optional opaque cursor, active count, capture limits, schema version, and storage warnings. It is exposed through the constrained `window.kunGui.runtimeRequest` allowlist. There is no write or replay endpoint.

## Using Agent Perspective

1. Open or select a Code conversation.
2. Select **Agent Perspective** (the scan/perspective icon) in the right rail.
3. Pick an attempt in the left request timeline.
4. Use **Overview**, **Request**, **Response**, and **Decoded** to compare the provider wire data with Kun's parsed result.
5. Switch between formatted JSON and raw text where available. Copy actions copy only the already-sanitized DTO shown by the panel.
6. Use **Load older requests** to page backward. While the panel is visible and the thread runs, it refreshes once per second and performs one final refresh when the turn settles.

Useful diagnosis patterns:

- `404` or wrong path: compare **Final request URL** with provider Base URL and Endpoint format settings.
- Provider rejects a field: compare the initial and `stream_options` fallback request bodies.
- A retry changes the outcome: compare status, response body, timing, and attempt reason across records.
- UI output differs from provider output: compare **Raw response** with **Decoded**.
- Missing early data: capture begins only after the runtime containing this feature starts; requests made by older builds are not reconstructed.

## Validation targets

Focused coverage lives in:

- `kun/src/services/model-request-trace-safety.test.ts`
- `kun/src/services/model-request-trace-store.test.ts`
- `kun/src/adapters/model/compat-model-client.observability.test.ts`
- `kun/src/server/routes/model-requests.test.ts`
- `src/renderer/src/agent/model-request-traces.test.ts`
- `src/renderer/src/components/workbench/useModelRequestTraces.test.ts`
- `src/renderer/src/components/workbench/AgentPerspectivePanel.test.ts`

Run the focused suites first, followed by top-level typecheck, `build:kun`, and the production build.
